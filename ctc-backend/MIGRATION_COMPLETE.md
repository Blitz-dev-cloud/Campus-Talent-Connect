## 🔐 Test Credentials

Use these to test your application:

| Role    | Email            | Password    |
| ------- | ---------------- | ----------- |
| Student | student@test.com | password123 |
| Alumni  | alumni@test.com  | password123 |
| Faculty | faculty@test.com | password123 |

## 📡 API Endpoints

All your existing API endpoints work the same way:

### Authentication (Public)

- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `POST /api/auth/register`

### Profiles

- `GET /api/profiles` - Get all profiles
- `GET /api/profiles/user/:userId` - Get profile by user ID
- `POST /api/profiles` - Create profile (protected)
- `PUT /api/profiles/:id` - Update profile (protected)

### Opportunities

- `GET /api/opportunities` - Get all opportunities
- `GET /api/opportunities/:id` - Get single opportunity
- `POST /api/opportunities` - Create opportunity (protected)
- `GET /api/opportunities/my-opportunities` - Get my opportunities (protected)

### Applications

- `GET /api/applications` - Get applications (filtered by role, protected)
- `POST /api/applications` - Submit application (protected)
- `PATCH /api/applications/:id` - Update status (protected)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### 1. Test Your Frontend

Your frontend should work without changes! Just make sure it's pointing to `http://localhost:8000`.

Start your frontend:

```powershell
cd d:\aws\ctc-1\ctc-frontend
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Key Features

- [ ] Login with test credentials
- [ ] View and edit student profile
- [ ] Browse opportunities
- [ ] Submit an application with CGPA and percentages
- [ ] Check that data persists after page refresh

### 3. Monitor the Server

The MongoDB server is running in the background. To see logs or errors, check the terminal where it's running.

---

## 🔄 Server Management

### Stop the Server

Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running

### Start the Server Again

```powershell
cd d:\aws\ctc-1\ctc-backend
npm run start:mongodb
```

### Development Mode (with auto-reload)

```powershell
npm run dev:mongodb
```

### Reseed the Database

```powershell
npm run seed:mongodb
```

## 🆚 Old vs New

| Aspect              | JSON Server (Old)  | MongoDB (New)           |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Server File**     | `server.js`        | `server-mongodb.js`     |
| **Start Command**   | `npm start`        | `npm run start:mongodb` |
| **Database**        | `db.json` file     | MongoDB Atlas           |
| **IDs**             | Integers (1, 2, 3) | ObjectIds (507f1f77...) |
| **Passwords**       | Plain text ❌      | Hashed with bcrypt ✅   |
| **Scalability**     | Limited            | Production-ready ✅     |
| **Data Validation** | None               | Mongoose schemas ✅     |

---

## 💡 Important Notes

### 1. MongoDB ObjectIds

MongoDB uses ObjectIds instead of integer IDs. Your frontend should handle these automatically, but if you see issues, check the comparison logic in places where you match IDs.

### 2. Password Security

Passwords are now properly hashed with bcrypt. The test passwords are "password123" but stored as hashed values in the database.

### 3. Academic Fields

Applications now include:

- `cgpa` (CGPA score)
- `tenth_percentage` (10th grade percentage)
- `twelfth_percentage` (12th grade percentage)

These fields are submitted from the `StudentDashboard.tsx` application modal.

### 4. Resume Upload

Resume files are still stored as base64 strings in the `resume_base64` field. The 50MB limit is set to handle large PDFs.

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Server Won't Start

```powershell
# Check if port 8000 is in use
# Stop any other servers running on port 8000
```

### Can't Connect to MongoDB

```powershell
# Test your connection
node test-connection.js

# Check your .env file has correct MONGODB_URI
```

### 401 Unauthorized Errors

- Make sure you're logged in
- Check JWT token is being sent in Authorization header
- Token expires after 24 hours - try logging in again

### Data Not Persisting

- Make sure MongoDB server is running
- Check terminal for error messages
- Verify .env has correct MongoDB URI
