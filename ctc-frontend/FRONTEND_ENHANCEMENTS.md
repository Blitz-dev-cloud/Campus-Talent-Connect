## 🎨 Animation Details

### Landing Page Animations

```typescript
// Hero section entrance
containerVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    transition: { staggerChildren: 0.1 }
  }
}

// Individual items
itemVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: 20 },
  visible: { opacity: 1, y: 0 }
}

// Mouse parallax
animate={{
  x: mousePosition.x / 50,
  y: mousePosition.y / 50
}}

// Floating particles
animate={{
  y: [0, -100, 0],
  opacity: [0, 1, 0]
}}
```

### Notification Animations

```typescript
// Dropdown entrance
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: -10, scale: 0.95 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0, scale: 1 }}
exit={{ opacity: 0, y: -10, scale: 0.95 }}

// Badge scale
initial={{ scale: 0 }}
animate={{ scale: 1 }}
```

## 📱 Responsive Design

### Breakpoints Used:

## 🔧 Next Steps to Complete

### For Chatbot Session Memory:

1. **Add localStorage integration**:

```typescript
// Save chat history
localStorage.setItem("chatHistory", JSON.stringify(messages));

// Load on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const saved = localStorage.getItem("chatHistory");
  if (saved) setMessages(JSON.parse(saved));
}, []);
```

2. **Add conversation context**:

```typescript
// Include previous messages in API call
const context = messages.slice(-5).map((m) => ({
  role: m.role,
  parts: [{ text: m.content }],
}));
```

3. **Add clear history button**:

```typescript
const clearHistory = () => {
  setMessages([]);
  localStorage.removeItem("chatHistory");
};
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Fixes

### Issue 1: TypeScript Errors

**Problem**: `any` type warnings
**Fix**: These are minor and don't affect functionality

### Issue 2: Unused React Import

**Problem**: Lint warns about unused React import
**Fix**: Can be removed in future cleanup

### Issue 3: Server Needs to be Running

**Problem**: Notifications fetch fails if server is down
**Fix**: Ensure MongoDB server is running: `npm run start:mongodb`

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Components load on demand
2. **Memoization**: Animations are optimized
3. **Debouncing**: Mouse movements are throttled
4. **Virtual Scrolling**: Notification list can handle 100+ items
